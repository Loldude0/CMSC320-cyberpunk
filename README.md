### Analysing Cyberpunk 2077 steam reviews

## Why we chose this dataset?

We chose this dataset because we are heavily invested in the entire lifecycle of the game Cyberpunk 2077. Since it's release, the game has recieved heavy criticism for it's performance and bugs. We wanted to see if the reviews on steam reflected the same sentiment in the beginning as well as analyse how the game improved over time.
